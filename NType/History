21-11-27, Satoshi Tanake (exampleN03-V02-00-04)
- The macro initInter.mac (by Michel) is revised.
  1) The command "/vis/scene/create" is removed, 
     since it is already included in "/vis/drawVolume".
  2) /vis/viewer/update is added, since it becomes necessary 
     when the OpenGL driver is switched to another driver.
- In visTutor/exN03Vis5,6.mac (by Guy) 
   "/vis/include/trajectories" is renamed into 
   "/vis/scene/add/trajectories" and also commented out. 
  (All other "/vis/scene/add/trajectories"'s are already commented out 
   by Michel, since the C++ method DrawTrajectory() is now described 
   in the event action.
- Unnecessary "/vis/scene/create" are removed from 
  visTutor/exN03VisX.mac when it is already included in 
  "/vis/drawVolume" or "/vis/specify". 
- The command /vis/camera/viewpoint is removed from visTutor/exN03Vis0.mac
  in order to avoid crushing in reading it in execution of 
  the G4 executable: $(G4BINDIR)/exampleN03 exN03Vis0.mac .
